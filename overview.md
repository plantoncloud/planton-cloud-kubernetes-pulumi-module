# Overview

The PlantonCloud Kubernetes Pulumi module is designed to streamline the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters within the PlantonCloud ecosystem. By leveraging Pulumi's infrastructure as code capabilities and adhering to a standardized Kubernetes API resource model, this module aims to provide a seamless and consistent approach to provisioning Kubernetes resources across multiple cloud providers. The module accepts a `PlantonCloudKubernetesStackInput` specification, which includes essential configurations such as Kubernetes cluster credentials, enabling it to initialize and manage the Kubernetes provider effectively. This integration facilitates automated setup processes, ensuring that Kubernetes clusters are configured correctly and efficiently based on the provided specifications.

Currently, the PlantonCloud Kubernetes Pulumi module is in its initial stages of development and is not fully implemented. While the module successfully establishes a connection to the Kubernetes cluster using the provided credentials, it does not yet support the creation or management of additional Kubernetes resources. Future iterations of the module will expand its capabilities to include comprehensive resource provisioning, configuration management, and output handling to fully realize the potential of unified API-driven infrastructure deployment. Users are encouraged to monitor the repository for updates and contribute to the ongoing development to help enhance the module's functionality and support a wider range of Kubernetes deployment scenarios.
